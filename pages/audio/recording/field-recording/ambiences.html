            I began recording things during the pandemic after I started micing
            up my guqin for online lessons with a borrowed microphone. I didn't
            know anything about best practices while recording acoustic
            instruments or anything about EQing and post-production. The first
            thing I noticed was how much more accurately I could hear the slide
            notes with my guqin. The second thing I noticed was how loud the
            sounds of my shared apartment were.
            <br /><br />
            I began to embrace the honesty and imperfections of my early
            recordings, including my frustrating guqin practice, the sounds of
            my flatmates in the apartment, as well as the atmosphere of the
            neighborhood outside. Eventually, I began to capture more recordings
            outside to capture the unique ambiences of the surrounding areas.
            The early pandemic completely transformed the soundscape of my
            neighborhood, and I began to appreciate the significance of formerly
            mundane sounds like the bustle of my street.
            <br /><br />
            With a focus on the relevance of every sound within the history of
            its location, I continue to explore the everyday noises that mark
            the distinct character of a place. I categorize and number each of
            my recordings, leaving room for the possibility of recapturing that
            location in the future.
