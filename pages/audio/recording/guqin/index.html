            The guqin is a seven-stringed zither instrument that is over 3,000
            years old. I’ve been studying guqin since 2019 with Weeteng Soh’s
            Cool Fragrance Qin Loft, based out of Singapore. She is of the
            Guangling Pai lineage of players, originating from the Jiangnan area
            of China. Since the pandemic, we have done early morning video
            lessons. Because of the 12-hour time difference, our lessons begin
            at 7am or 8am, depending on daylight savings.
            <br /><br />
            I first discovered the instrument after attending an introductory
            class I was invited to by a friend while working in Singapore, and I
            immediately fell in love with the quiet, bassy tone of the
            instrument. Attending that intro class was fateful in many ways, but
            most of all it initiated my (re)introduction to working with sound.
            <br /><br />
            There are many challenges that come with learning only through
            video, and most of the resources for guqin are not yet translated to
            English. I try to record regularly to capture improvement.
