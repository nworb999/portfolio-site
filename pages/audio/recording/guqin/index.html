            The guqin is a seven-stringed zither that is over 3,000
            years old. I’ve been studying guqin since 2019 with Weeteng Soh’s
            Cool Fragrance Qin Loft, based out of Singapore. She is of the
            Guangling Pai lineage of players, originating from the Jiangnan area
            of China. Since the pandemic, we have done video lessons. Because of
            the time difference, our lessons began at 7am or 8am in New York
            City, and 9pm or 8pm in Santa Barbara.
            <br /><br />
            I first discovered the instrument after attending an introductory
            class I was invited to by a friend while working in Singapore, and I
            immediately fell in love with the quiet, bassy tone.
