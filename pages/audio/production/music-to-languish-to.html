            <strong>music to languish to</strong>
            <em>(2022 - present)</em> is a soundtrack to do nothing to. More
            specifically, it is an ongoing project where I upload loops from my
            eurorack that evoke similar feelings of aimless relaxation. Without
            a formal background in music, I've gravitated more towards
            generating textures than composing music, and I source tracks that
            fit the criteria for this project while listening back to live jams.
            <br /><br />
            I'm often working while listening to music, and in order to focus, I
            listen to repetitive music. I like the idea of music to do things
            to, and music often has the utilitarian task of motivating me
            throughout different parts of my day. However, instead of curating
            more music to work to, I wanted to focus on feelings of
            unproductivity. The pandemic brought an increased scrutinization of
            productivity culture, including the rise of social movements such as
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_ping">躺平</a>
            <em>(tǎng píng)</em>, or "lying flat", and activities previously
            considered pointless gained new relevance.
