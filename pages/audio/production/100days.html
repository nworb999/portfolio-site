            After seeing my friends do a 100 days challenge for their graduate
            program, I was inspired to do the same. I wanted to force myself to
            work with sound every day, even if it meant lightly EQing a field
            recording. I worked from Winter 2021 to Spring 2022.
            <br /><br />
            Naturally, the main obstacle was the fear of making bad stuff.
            Forcing myself to upload early and often had been an important part
            of my practice in order to overcome that anxiety, but this project
            was especially challenging because I uploaded the result of each
            session, no matter how unhappy I was with it. It helped me take
            myself less seriously and see each work as part of an ongoing
            progression.
            <br /><br />
            I primarily used Ableton Live along with my Moog DFAM, Pocket
            Operator Sub, and the Make Noise Morphagene. I'm generally more
            comfortable working with only hardware so I pushed myself to use the
            DAW for most tracks. I also experimented with story-telling by
            mixing field recordings and synth samples together.
            <br /><br />
            In hindsight, while I learned a lot from maintaining a daily
            practice, I found that forcing myself to post a result every day
            caused me to cut corners instead of try new things, especially given
            the small window of time after my day-job that I had to work.
