            The concept for my first live performance centered around a guqin
            tune I was learning at the time -- <strong>招隱</strong>, which can
            translate both to "Seeking Seclusion" and "Summoning the Recluse"
            (<a href="http://www.silkqin.com/02qnpu/07sqmp/sq09zy.htm"
              >more info here</a
            >).<br /><br />
            My plan was to record a take of myself performing the song to use as
            a sample, but my city apartment isn't exactly soundproof. One
            particularly loud practice session was recorded on a Saturday night
            in May 2022, with sirens criss-crossing the street outside and the
            subway rumbling every minute below. Since I wanted to continue
            practicing the tune and the modular set in parallel, I went ahead
            and loaded it into the Morphagene. I soon realized that the sirens,
            the subway, and my own voice mumbling about the noise lent both
            texture and character to the piece, so I decided to use that
            practice session for the performance. I spend so much time in my
            bedroom, and I have conflicting feelings about it as a place where I
            feel both inspired and rejuvenated, but also frustrated and trapped.
            I thought that the ambiance of my room lent authenticity, and even a
            new dimension, to the theme of the guqin tune.<br /><br />
            For my performance, the sample (linked below) was processed live
            with the Morphagene (Make Noise) and the Cold Mac (Mannequins), and
            sequenced by the Stages (Mutable Instruments). <br /><br />
            Curated and run by <a href="https://www.cy-kim.com/">Cy Kim</a>,
            Sonar Flare was a noise show showcasing the work of NYU ITP students
            from Sound Garden, a collective of music technology researchers that
            Cy also founded. Originally intended to take place at a warehouse
            venue, it ended up taking place on my patio in May 2022.
