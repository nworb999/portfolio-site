            My initial plan for this performance was to use a recording from a
            funeral where I read "Crossing the Bar", by Alfred Tennyson. I
            wanted to focus on the theme of transition, but the choir recording
            I had been using was challenging to make musical at every pitch with
            the sampler I was using. Instead, I wanted to try and move away from
            using music samples altogether and see what I could create with a
            similar setup as my first performance but with no music. The night
            before my second performance, I scrapped the set that I had
            practiced for weeks and started over. <br /><br />I took a recording
            of a bridge over the Mississippi River in Memphis taken before the
            funeral and mixed it with a recording of a dawn chorus in Chatsworth
            Park taken after the funeral. It was processed live with a
            Morphagene (Make Noise), Stages (Mutable Instruments), a Cold Mac
            (Mannequins), and a 2hp comb filter. <br /><br />Sonar Flare II was
            a follow-up event in August 2022 curated and run by
            <a href="https://www.cy-kim.com/">Cy Kim</a> where I was invited to
            play at a second time. This time, it took place at the original
            warehouse location in East Williamsburg called Hex House. My set was
            accompanied by live visuals from
