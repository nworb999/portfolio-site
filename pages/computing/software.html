              At my last job, I was a software engineer working at a cloud
              storage company, where I did backend and infrastructure work. I
              primarily used
              <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Typescript</strong>,
              <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>Terraform</strong>,
              <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>Next.js</strong>. I recently
              started doing frontend web development on the side. I coded this
              website by hand with just <strong>HTML</strong>,
              <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong>.

            Before I became a software engineer, I started my career in data
            science. My first programming language was <strong>R</strong>, which
            I taught myself in university. I loved making visualizations using
            <strong>ggplot2</strong> and spending hours learning new
            <strong>LaTeX</strong>
            formatting techniques. I knew that after university, I wanted a role
            where I would program for the majority of my day. For an economics
            graduate, data science made the most sense. In the first few years
            of my career, I relied mainly on
            <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>. A highlight of my
            time in data science was when I was working at a newspaper and took
            part in a winning team for <strong>BBC's 2020 News Hack</strong>.
            Our proposed "source" index for articles (rather than traditional
            topic or author indexing) provided a new dimension with which to
            explore the paper's content. This would not only allow readers to
            search through articles by the people interviewed e.g. quotes from
            prospective homebuyers in the Midwest or comments from sociologists
            based out of NYC, it would also allow for audits of news source
            diversity.
