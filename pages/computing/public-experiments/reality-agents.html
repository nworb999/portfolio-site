                        <em>(2024) </em>
                        A satirical reality TV production company that uses agent-based systems to combat the
                        industry’s exploitative nature. The result is a sterile screenplay that is different every
                        time. As opposed to simply generating a script using a Large Language Model (LLM), this work
                        extends generative agent technology and agent-based systems, developed this past summer at
                        Stanford University, to power separate completely autonomous agents with their own
                        personality, emotional state, intentions and objectives. Drawing on cognitive science
                        research, particularly hot cognition—which explores the interaction between emotions and
                        decision-making—the software aims to reverse engineer emergent behaviors in agent-based
                        systems. This approach fosters dynamic and unpredictable synthetic dramas poised to improve
                        as long as LLMs do.
